### Hi there iÂ´m Joaquin ğŸ‘‹

Today I would like to share with you a passion that has come to define much of my life: programming. Ever since I delved into the world of coding, I have discovered a fascinating universe of possibilities and limitless creativity. Let me tell you why I love programming so much and why I have chosen to study this art in depth.
Firstly, programming is a powerful tool for bringing ideas to life. Have you ever had a vision of something you wish existed in the world? With programming, I can turn those visions into reality. From simple scripts to complex applications, the act of programming allows me to materialize my thoughts and share them with the world.
