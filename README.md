# ðŸ’« About Me:
Today I would like to share with you a passion that has come to define much of my life: programming. Ever since I delved into the world of coding, I have discovered a fascinating universe of possibilities and limitless creativity. Let me tell you why I love programming so much and why I have chosen to study this art in depth.
Firstly, programming is a powerful tool for bringing ideas to life. Have you ever had a vision of something you wish existed in the world? With programming, I can turn those visions into reality. From simple scripts to complex applications, the act of programming allows me to materialize my thoughts and share them with the world.

<p>Furthermore, programming is a constant challenge that keeps me constantly growing. Every problem I encounter is an opportunity to learn something new. Whether it's fixing syntax errors or designing complex algorithms, every line of code written is a step towards mastering this art.

<p> This year im studying a sueperior degree of  Web Application Development i learned yet Java,MySql,Sql Server, Xml validator code and transform different languajes, BaseX, Oracle, Linux and I am studiying by my own more languajes that a would like to learn and work with like C++ or Python.
IÂ´m just in the fisrt year but it doesnÂ´t matters i know that i want to learn more code styles, new programs and take it to the highest level to increase my experience and habilities with the new codes.Im open to leanr new technologies and programming languages.
I would love to work and studying as the same time because i wanna know how this world works in the real life and take some skills to imnprove my knowledge, one of the things that i have in my favor its learn fast i just need nice base of some programs , codes or languajes 
and I get by applying myself on focus.
