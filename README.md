### Hi there iÂ´m Joaquin # ðŸ’« About Me:
Today I would like to share with you a passion that has come to define much of my life: programming. Ever since I delved into the world of coding, I have discovered a fascinating universe of possibilities and limitless creativity. Let me tell you why I love programming so much and why I have chosen to study this art in depth.<br><br>
Firstly, programming is a powerful tool for bringing ideas to life. Have you ever had a vision of something you wish existed in the world? With programming, I can turn those visions into reality. From simple scripts to complex applications, the act of programming allows me to materialize my thoughts and share them with the world.<br><br>
This year i just begining learning Web Application Development with some programs and codes like Java , Oracle , SQL ,MySql , BaseX , XML and i learning by my own differets languajes like Python or C++ i  really like to work with them but i appreciate if i have to learn others codes or new programs and technologies. IÂ´d like to work and studying as the same time because I am very curious  to know this world  works and how it develops to improve my knowledge.It is a constant learning process and I love discovering new ways to solve different problems.<br><br>
I just practically finished the first year and with very good grades and i am so impatient to learn Web development in client environment,Web development in a server environment, Deployment of web applications, Design of web interface.<br><br>
